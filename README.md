These modules are vital for interacting with the Ethernity Cloud Runner and defining the runner type.

2. **Defining Code to be Executed:**

   The Ethernity Cloud Runner allows users to execute tasks using different programming languages and frameworks. Currently, the runner supports two main templates: Python and Node.js. Users can define the code to be executed within these templates to perform specific tasks on the Ethernity Cloud platform.
   
   #### Python Template:
   
   In the Python template, users can write their code in Python programming language. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for various use cases. Users can utilize the Python template to execute tasks that require data processing, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and more. The Python template provides a flexible and versatile environment to build sophisticated applications within the Ethernity Cloud ecosystem.
   
   Below there is an example of Python code that demonstrates a program used to compute PI number:
   
   ```python
   import time
   from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
             
   def compute(n):
     getcontext().prec = n
     res = Decimal(0)
     for i in range(n):
       a = Decimal(1)/(16**i)
       b = Decimal(4)/(8*i+1)
       c = Decimal(2)/(8*i+4)
       d = Decimal(1)/(8*i+5)
       e = Decimal(1)/(8*i+6)
       r = a*(b-c-d-e)
       res += r
     return res
             
   t1 = time.time()
   res = compute(2000)
   dt = time.time()-t1
                 
   print(res)
   ___etny_result___(str(res))
   ```
   
   
   #### Node.js Template:
   
   For those who prefer JavaScript, the Node.js template offers a powerful option. Node.js allows users to leverage JavaScript both on the client and server-side, making it suitable for web-based applications and server-side scripting. With the Node.js template, users can execute tasks on the Ethernity Cloud Runner using JavaScript, taking advantage of its asynchronous, event-driven nature and extensive library support.
   
   Below there is an example of Node.js code that computes the sum of two numbers:
   
   ```javascript
   function add(a, b) {
     return a + b;
   }
   ___etny_result___(add(1, 10).toString());
   ```
   
   To use either template, users need to provide the code in the corresponding programming language that defines the specific task they want to execute. This code will be packaged and executed within the Ethernity Cloud environment, leveraging the capabilities of the blockchain and distributed computing to complete the task securely and efficiently.
   
   It's important to note that as the Ethernity Cloud platform evolves, additional templates and language support may be introduced, providing even more flexibility for users to define and execute a wide range of tasks on the Ethernity Cloud Runner. For now, users can take advantage of the Python and Node.js templates to harness the power of blockchain and distributed computing for their applications and tasks.

3. **App Function Component:**
   Define the `App` function component, which plays a pivotal role in rendering the entire application.

4. **Rendering the Button:**
   The return statement of the `App` function renders a button labeled "Execute Task." Clicking the button triggers the `executeTask` function, initiating task execution through the Ethernity Cloud Runner.

5. **Execute Task Function:**
   Within the `App` function, define the `executeTask` function as an asynchronous function that triggers upon clicking the "Execute task" button.

6. **Runner Initialization:**
   The first crucial step involves creating an instance of the `EthernityCloudRunner`. Initialize the runner by constructing `const runner = new EthernityCloudRunner();`.

7. **Decentralized Storage Initialization:**
   Next, initialize the Ethernity Cloud Runner's decentralized storage by specifying the IPFS address where it will communicate with the IPFS network. For this integration, you have multiple options to initialize the storage:

   - **Ethernity Cloud IPFS Server (Recommended for Development):** 
      
   Utilize the default IPFS address 'https://ipfs.ethernity.cloud:5001' provided by Ethernity Cloud, which serves as an efficient option for development purposes. It ensures seamless initialization with the specified IPFS address, allowing you to focus on task execution without managing your own IPFS infrastructure.

   - **Custom IPFS Server:**
   
   Alternatively, if you have your own IPFS server set up or prefer to use a different IPFS address, you can provide the desired IPFS address to the runner.initializeStorage(ipfsAddress) method. This option empowers you to leverage any IPFS infrastructure that suits your specific requirements.

   - **Other Decentralized Storage Solutions:**
   
   Ethernity Cloud Runner offers the flexibility to integrate with various decentralized storage solutions beyond IPFS. While IPFS is the default and recommended option, you can explore other decentralized storage systems based on your needs and preferences.

   In summary, initializing the Ethernity Cloud Runner's decentralized storage plays a crucial role in enabling seamless communication with the IPFS network or other decentralized storage solutions. Whether you opt for the provided Ethernity Cloud IPFS server, your custom IPFS infrastructure, or other decentralized storage, this integration ensures efficient task execution and data management within your React application.

8. **Task Execution:**
The heart of the integration lies in the `await runner.run(...)` line, which initiates task execution through the Ethernity Cloud Runner. The `runner.run(...)` function accepts three arguments:

    - **Runner Type:** Specify the runner type, with currently two runners available for use on the TESTNET network:
        - Python runner: `ECRunner.PYNITHY_RUNNER_TESTNET`
        - Node.js runner: `ECRunner.NODENITHY_RUNNER_TESTNET`

    - **Code:** Provide the code to be executed as the task. For this example, it contains the Python code snippet to be executed (Ensure to preserve proper indentations).

    - **Node Address (Optional):** Include this argument if you wish to provide The Ethereum wallet address (node address) for processing the task. The Ethernity Cloud Runner offers two options for task approval:

        - **Manual Approval:** If you omit the node address, the task execution will be manually approved, allowing users to review the task details before execution proceeds. 

        - **Automatic Approval:** If you choose to provide the node address, the task execution will be automatically approved, providing a seamless and quick execution process without manual intervention.
9. **Metamask Interaction when Executing a Task:**

When executing a task with the Ethernity Cloud Runner, Metamask, a popular Ethereum wallet browser extension, plays a significant role in the process. Here's a step-by-step guide on how Metamask interacts with the task execution:

1. **Connecting Metamask:**
   Before initiating the task execution, ensure that Metamask is installed and set up in your web browser. If you haven't done so already, install Metamask and create or import an Ethereum wallet address.

2. **Logging in and Approving the Task:**
   When you click the "Execute task" button in the React application, the `executeTask` function is triggered. The Ethernity Cloud Runner will then prompt Metamask to request account access, enabling it to interact with your Ethereum wallet. If you haven't logged in to Metamask, you will be prompted to do so at this point.

3. **Approving Transaction:**
   After logging in, Metamask will display a transaction confirmation popup. This popup provides details about the task being executed, such as the runner type and the Python code snippet. Review the transaction details and confirm the task execution by clicking the "Confirm" button within Metamask.

4. **Transaction Processing:**
   Once you confirm the transaction, Metamask will initiate the process of executing the task on the Ethereum network. The transaction will be broadcasted to the network, and you can monitor its progress through Metamask.

5. **Transaction Confirmation:**
   As the task execution is processed, Metamask will provide a transaction confirmation once the task is successfully executed on the network. You will receive a confirmation message in Metamask, indicating that the task execution has been completed.

6. **Task Result Retrieval:**
   After the task execution is confirmed, the Ethernity Cloud Runner will retrieve the result of the executed task from the Ethereum network. The result will be displayed in the React application, indicating the outcome of the Python code execution.

By leveraging Metamask's secure and user-friendly interface, the Ethernity Cloud Runner seamlessly interacts with your Ethereum wallet, ensuring the secure and efficient execution of tasks within your React application. Metamask serves as the bridge between your application and the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating a smooth and decentralized experience when running tasks on the Ethernity Cloud platform.

In conclusion, the above-mentioned code elegantly integrates the Ethernity Cloud Runner into your React app, enabling seamless execution of Python code snippets while facilitating interaction with the IPFS network for efficient data storage and retrieval.
